= ROBOKOP Neo4j Plugin
:neo4j_version: 3.2.6

This plugin contains custom functions and procedures to assist the ROBOKOP Neo4j interface.

[Note]
This plugin is built for Neo4j {neo4j_version}, though it does not depend on any deprecated features.

=== Traversable

This function allows you to identify whether a subgraph is traversable from a set of labeled nodes, respecting the directions of edges.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p=(n {name:'disease'})-[*0..6]-(m {name:'gene'})
WHERE robokop.traversable(nodes(p), relationships(p), [n, m])
RETURN p
----

== Building

This project uses maven, to build a jar-file with the function in this
project, simply package the project with maven:

    mvn clean package

This will produce a jar-file, `target/robokop-1.0.0.jar`,
that can be deployed in the `plugin` directory of your Neo4j instance.
